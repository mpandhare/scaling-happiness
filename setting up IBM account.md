# Step 5: Set preferences for receiving notifications

Complete the following steps to set your preferences for receiving various types of notifications:

To receive notifications about IBM Cloud platform-related, or resource-related items, go to the Avatar icon Avatar icon Profile > Notification preferences.

When you set IBM Cloud platform notifications, you receive email notifications that are associated with only the platform. You do not receive notifications about events that are associated with IBM Cloud services. By default, all platform notifications are turned off.
If you update your preferences on resource activity, such as incidents, maintenance, security bulletins, or infrastructure service updates, the notifications are for only the services you use or the devices that you have provisioned. By default, all infrastructure notifications are turned off.
To receive spending notifications, go to Manage > Billing and usage > Spending notifications in the IBM Cloud console. Or, you can access it directly from the Notification preferences page by clicking Manage in the Billing and Usage section.

You receive notifications when you reach 80%, 90%, and 100% of the spending thresholds that you specify. Enter the dollar amount to set a spending threshold when setting up your spending notification. For more information, see Setting spending notifications.
